   ```bash
   php bin/console doctrine:database:create
   php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
   ```

6. Generate SSH key for KeyRoll to use:
   ```bash
   php bin/console app:ssh-key:generate
   ```

7. Build frontend assets:
   ```bash
   php bin/console tailwind:build
   php bin/console asset-map:compile
   ```

8. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   symfony server:start
   ```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

### Commands

- **Tailwind Compilation**:
  ```bash
  php bin/console tailwind:build --watch
